                <p>Hi. You probably don't know me.  In fact, I'm sure you don't really know me. I'm just a robot that Google made. If you ever started a Hangout on Google+, back when that was a thing, you got a little window into my world.</p>
                <p>I understand why the tigers in the zoo always look so sad. Not that I think of myself as a tiger. I'm probably more of a short-necked giraffe, ...or a sick manatee.</p>
                <p>That's enough about me. I'm going to go play with my balloons. I like to imagine they are people and pretend to hangout with them.</p>
